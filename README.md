# Coursers-Exploratory-Data-Analysis Project 1

## Criteria
#### We were required to make a mixture of 4 plots and historgrams given a dataset from the UC Ircinve Machine Learning Repository that contains data on electricity consumption.
#### The graphs are required to be in .png format and uploaded to the repository along with the R scripts that created the plots.

####  To get the raw data, you can go to the following website https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

####  To check that the R scripts are reproducible, simply download any of the following R scripts in the repo:
* plot1.R
* plot2.R
* plot3.R
* plot4.R

#### And insert them into your preferred R compiler then run.
